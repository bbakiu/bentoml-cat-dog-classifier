# Pet Classifier CNN and served with BentoML

In this small project, I build a small classifier where based on the picture, it will determine if it's a dog or cat. The accuracy does not seem to be the best, but as I was mostly interested in practicing the concepts and using BentoML, that is not very important to me now. However in the near future I plan to train some other models and pick the one with the best accuracy.

## Setup:


## Credits:
1. https://github.com/abaranovskis-redsamurai/automation-repo/tree/master/convnet - source I used for the model
2. `find_broken_images.py` was found somewhere in the internet, and I no longer can find the real source. Kudos to the person who wrote that piece of code.
